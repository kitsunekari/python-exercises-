Case Study
Toronto Pearson Airport has contracted your company to develop a luggage pricing system. Travellers will place their luggage on a scale and will be charged a fee depending on the weight of their luggage. The pricing sheet for luggage is as follows:


Develop a program that outputs a price based on an inputted weight (remember, prices and weights can be represented as numerics - floats and integers).

My code: 

```
weight = int(input("Enter in the weight of your luggage"))

if weight < 15:
    print("Your price is $14.99")
elif weight >= 15 and weight <= 20:
    print("Your price is $24.99")
elif weight > 21 and weight <= 30:
    print("Your price is $26.99")
elif weight > 31 and weight <= 40:
    print("Your price is $29.99")
elif weight > 41 and weight <= 50:
    print("Your price is $34.99")
else:
    print ("I'm sorry! We don't accept that weight.")

```
