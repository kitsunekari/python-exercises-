Case Study
Letâ€™s replicate the Chipotle Nutrition Calculator. To get a feel for how the calculator works, go to the following url: 
chipotle.ca/nutrition-calculator.html. 
Next, write a series of conditional statements that calculates the total calories in a meal (only account for three types 
of toppings in each toppings category). 
Hint: Before writing the conditional statements, create a variable for each topping that holds the calorie count for that 
specific topping.


My code: 

```
flour = 320
rice = 170
chicken = 210
steak = 150 

carbOrder = input("Would you like flour or rice?")

if carbOrder == "flour":
    meatOrder = input("Would you like chicken or steak?")
    if "chicken":
        totalCalories = chicken + flour
        print("Your burrito is {} calories".format(totalCalories))
    else:
        totalCalories = steak + flour
        print("Your burrito is {} calories".format(totalCalories))    
elif carbOrder == "rice":
    meatOrder = input("Would you like chicken or steak?")
    if "chicken":
        totalCalories = chicken + rice
        print("Your burrito is {} calories".format(totalCalories))
    else:
        totalCalories = steak + rice
        print("Your burrito is {} calories".format(totalCalories))  
else:
    print("testing.")
 ```
