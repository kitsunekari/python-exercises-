Joe’s Pizza 

Joe’s Pizza Palace needs a program to calculate the number of slices a pizza of any size can divided into. 

Area = 3.14 * d/2 * d/2 

Given that each slice must be 14.125 inches 

Two inputs 
1. d = diameter of the pizza 
2. no. of slices 


Code: 

Pizza Program: 

pizzaDiameter = int(input("Enter in the diameter of the pizza:"))

pizzaSliceNumber = int(input("Enter in the number of slices you want")) 

eachSlice = 14.125

pizzaAreaSize = 3.14 * pizzaDiameter/2 * pizzaDiameter/2

totalNumberOfSlices = pizzaAreaSize / pizzaSliceNumber

print ("This is the total number of slices you can get from this pizza:", totalNumberOfSlices)
