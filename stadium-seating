Programming Challenge 1 - Stadium Seating 

There are three seating categories at a stadium 
For a softball game, Class A seats $15, Class B seats cost $12, and Class C seats cost $9. Write a program that asks how many tickets for each class of seats were sold, then displays the amount of income generated from ticket sales. 

```
classA = 15

classB = 12

classC = 9

seatsClassA = classA*20

seatsClassB = classB*150

seatsClassC = classC*500

netSales = seatsClassA + seatsClassB + seatsClassC

print (netSales)



Code: 

```
classA = int (input("Enter the no. of Class A tickets"))

classB = int (input("Enter the no. of Class B tickets"))

classC = int (input("Enter the no. of Class C tickets"))

seatsClassA = classA*15

seatsClassB = classB*12

seatsClassC = classC*9

netSalesA = seatsClassA

netSalesB = seatsClassB

netSalesC = seatsClassC 

print (seatsClassA) 

print (seatsClassB)

print (seatsClassC) 
```
